# DirVim

DirVim is a simple terminal-based file explorer built using C++. It allows users to view the contents of the current working directory and navigate into subdirectories using text-based input.

## Features

- Lists all files and folders in the current directory
- Allows navigation into subdirectories by typing the folder name
- Supports moving up to the parent directory using `..`
- Quits the program using `q`
- Checks if the user input is a valid directory

## How It Works

The program uses the `dirent.h` library to interact with the file system. It displays the contents of the current directory, prompts the user to enter a directory name, and updates the view if the input is a valid directory.

## Build Instructions

To compile and run the project:


Make sure you have `make` and `g++` installed, along with `ncurses` if you plan to extend the UI.
